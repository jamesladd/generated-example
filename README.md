## ERROR
when run with 'bun run dev' there is a cli console error
```sh
8:43:32 am [vike][request(2)] HTTP response /lib/utils.js 404
```
when run in the browser there is a browser console error
```sh
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:3000/@id/__x00__virtual:vike:pageConfigValuesAll:client:/pages/index
```
when run with 'bun run build' and then 'bun run preview' the errors are not there.

when hono-entry.ts is updated to not server files in /lib the HTTP 404 error goes away!
however, the TypeError continues to stop the app working in the browser.

again, when running 'bun run build' and 'bun run preview' all errors are gone.

This app is ready to start. It's powered by [Vike](https://vike.dev) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html).

### `/pages/+config.ts`

Such `+` files are [the interface](https://vike.dev/config) between Vike and your code. It defines:

* A default [`<Layout>` component](https://vike.dev/Layout) (that wraps your [`<Page>` components](https://vike.dev/Page)).
* A default [`title`](https://vike.dev/title).
* Global [`<head>` tags](https://vike.dev/head-tags).

### Routing

[Vike's built-in router](https://vike.dev/routing) lets you choose between:

* [Filesystem Routing](https://vike.dev/filesystem-routing) (the URL of a page is determined based on where its `+Page.vue` file is located on the filesystem)
* [Route Strings](https://vike.dev/route-string)
* [Route Functions](https://vike.dev/route-function)

### `/pages/_error/+Page.vue`

The [error page](https://vike.dev/error-page) which is rendered when errors occur.

### `/pages/+onPageTransitionStart.ts` and `/pages/+onPageTransitionEnd.ts`

The [`onPageTransitionStart()` hook](https://vike.dev/onPageTransitionStart), together with [`onPageTransitionEnd()`](https://vike.dev/onPageTransitionEnd), enables you to implement page transition animations.

### SSR

SSR is enabled by default. You can [disable it](https://vike.dev/ssr) for all your pages or only for some pages.

### HTML Streaming

You can enable/disable [HTML streaming](https://vike.dev/stream) for all your pages, or only for some pages while still using it for others.

## *AWS CDK Deployment*

This is a boilerplate for deploying your Vike app to AWS using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) including creating a custom domain in Route53.

**Architecture:**

* S3 Bucket for static client assets (`/dist/client/assets`).
* Lambda function for the backend and SSR.
* CloudFront distribution for CDN and routing requests `/assets/*` to the S3 bucket.

This boilerplate is a starting point for deploying your Vike app to AWS. You can customize the deployment by modifying the `cdk/lib/vike-stack.ts` file.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure to configure your AWS credentials.

**Loading from a file:**

You can keep your AWS credentials in a file. The credentials are found at:

`~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, Unix, and macOS;
`C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

If the credentials file does not exist on your machine:

Download the AWS CLI from [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and configure your AWS credentials using the following command:
`aws configure`

And then use this guide to configure the credentials
The credentials file should look like:

`[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>`

**Loading from environment variables:**

AWS SDK automatically detects AWS credentials in your environment and uses them for making requests to AWS. The environment variables that you need to set are:

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
If you are using temporary credentials, also set:

`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
This is often the most convenient way to configure credentials when deploying your AWS CDK app in a CI environment.

> \[!NOTE]
> You should change the stack name to give your app stack a distinctive name in your AWS environment. You can do so by modifying the `infrastructure.ts.ts` file in the `cdk/bin` directory.

### Deployment to AWS

If you want to have a look at the synthesized CloudFormation template, you can run `pnpm cdk synth` and see the template as YAML on screen or in `cdk.out/VikeStack.template.json`.

> \[!NOTE]
> If this is your **first time deploying a CDK app** in this environment you need to **bootstrap**:
> `pnpm cdk bootstrap`. (The default region based on your AWS CLI configuration will be used)

You can deploy your Vike App via the following command:
`pnpm deploy:aws` or `pnpm cdk deploy`

The URL to the CloudFront distribution will be displayed in the output of the deployment.
You can also access the CloudFront distribution domainname in the AWS SSM registry und `vike/distribution/url`.

### Stack Configuration

You can configure the stack in the `cdk/bin/infrastructure.ts` file:

| Variable | Examples | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `domainName: "example.com",` | "example.com" |  |
| `subDomain: "www",` |"www" | |
| `certificate: undefined,` | "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012" or a certificatemanager.ICertificate | reuse an existing AWS Certificate |
| `hostedZone: undefined,` | route53.HostedZone.fromLookup(stack, "MyHostedZone", { domainName: "example.com" }) | |

If `domainName` is managed by **Route53**, the `hostedZone` will be updated with by lookup in Route53 based on the `domainName`.

These scenarios are supported:
A. `domainName` exists in Route53, `subDomain` is given - the subdomain with the domain are used as alternative domains for the CloudFront Distribution. An new Certificate for the url is created and assigned to the CF-Distribution. An Alias-Record pointing to the CF-Distribution ist created in Route53.
B. `domainName` exists in Route53, `subDomain` is given - the subdomain with the domain are used as alternative domains for the CloudFront Distribution. If `certificate` contains a valid entry it will be assigned to the CF-Distribution. An Alias-Record pointing to the CF-Distribution ist created in Route53.
C. `domainName` **does not exist** in Route53, `subDomain` is given - the subdomain with the domain are used as alternative domains for the CloudFront Distribution. If `certificate` contains a valid entry it will be assigned to the CF-Distribution. A manual created CNAME or A-Record should pointing to the CF-Distribution.

#### Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain, you can add it to the stack configuration in the `cdk/bin/infrastructure.ts` file:

> \[!NOTE]
> If you deploy your App to a region different than `us-east-1` and you have never deployed to this region before, you will need to bootstrap this region too:
> `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 pnpm deploy:cdk bootstrap`

### Destroying the Stack on AWS

To destroy the stack on AWS, run the following command:
`pnpm cdk destroy`

Or delete the CloudFormation stack which starts with "VikeStack-<Your App Name>" created by this project.
